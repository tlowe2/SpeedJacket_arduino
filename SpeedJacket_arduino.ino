// Based on code from Adafruit Industries

/*************************************************** 
  This is an example for our Adafruit 24-channel PWM/LED driver

  Pick one up today in the adafruit shop!

  These drivers uses SPI to communicate, 3 pins are required to  
  interface: Data, Clock and Latch. The boards are chainable
